# Child Data Storage Fix

## Problem Summary
Child profiles were not being persisted to the Neon database. When users created child profiles, the data was lost after server restart.

## Root Cause
The server was running in **development mode** with `USE_REAL_AI=true`, which used:
- `mockChildrenRouter` - stored children in memory (array), not database
- `devPlansRouter` - used real AI but expected database children

This created a mismatch where:
1. Children were stored in memory only
2. Plans tried to reference children from the database
3. Data was lost on server restart

## Solution

### Updated `mock-children.ts` to Use Real Database
Changed the mock router from in-memory storage to actual Neon database storage:

1. **Added database imports**:
   - `db` from config
   - `children` and `users` schema
   - Drizzle ORM helpers

2. **Created `ensureDevUserExists()` helper**:
   - Automatically creates a user record in the database for dev users
   - Maps Clerk user ID to database user ID
   - Prevents foreign key constraint errors

3. **Updated all routes to use database**:
   - **GET `/api/children`**: Fetches from database instead of memory array
   - **POST `/api/children`**: Inserts into database with proper user FK
   - **PUT `/api/children/:id`**: Updates database records
   - **DELETE `/api/children/:id`**: Deletes from database

4. **Added comprehensive logging**:
   - Logs user creation
   - Logs child CRUD operations
   - Logs errors for debugging

## Benefits

### ✅ Data Persistence
- Children are now stored in Neon database
- Data survives server restarts
- Proper relational integrity with users table

### ✅ Consistency
- Both development and production use the same data model
- Plans can properly reference children via foreign keys
- No more data mismatch issues

### ✅ Better Development Experience
- Dev users automatically created in database
- Full database features available in development
- Easier to test real-world scenarios

## Database Schema

The solution properly uses the existing schema:

```sql
-- Users table (auto-created for dev users)
CREATE TABLE users (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
    clerk_id VARCHAR(255) UNIQUE,
    email VARCHAR(255),
    name VARCHAR(255),
    created_at TIMESTAMP
);

-- Children table (now properly populated)
CREATE TABLE children (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
    user_id UUID REFERENCES users(id),  -- Proper FK relationship
    first_name VARCHAR(120),
    age_years INTEGER,
    neurotype VARCHAR(120),
    interests TEXT,
    learning_context VARCHAR(40),
    state VARCHAR(10),
    created_at TIMESTAMP
);
```

## Testing

1. **Create a child profile**:
   - Navigate to Child Profiles page
   - Create a new profile
   - Check server logs for "✅ Child profile created with ID"

2. **Verify persistence**:
   - Restart the server
   - Refresh the page
   - Child should still be there

3. **Generate a plan**:
   - Select the child
   - Generate a learning plan
   - Plan should properly reference the child from database

## Migration Notes

### For Existing Users
If you had children created before this fix:
- Old in-memory children are gone (they were never persisted)
- Users will need to recreate their child profiles
- This is a one-time issue

### For New Users
- Everything works seamlessly
- Children are automatically persisted
- No manual intervention needed

## Future Improvements

1. **Remove "mock" naming**: Since it now uses real database, consider renaming to `dev-children.ts`
2. **Seed data**: Add optional seed data for development
3. **Migration script**: Create script to handle schema changes
4. **Better error messages**: User-friendly error messages for database issues
